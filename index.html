<br>
<h3><b>1. Factors to determine population
distribution : </b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Relief (Landforms) : Population is densely
distributed on flat plains and gentle slopes.
This is because such areas are favourable
for the production of crops. In these areas
it is easier to build roads and develop
industries. </li>
<li>Climate : Extreme climates such as very
hot or cold deserts or regions with very
heavy rainfall are uncomfortable for human
habitation. They have less population.
Areas with an equable climate, where there
is not much seasonal variation, attract
more people. Mediterranean regions were
inhabited due to their pleasant climate.</li>
<li>Availability of water : It is the most
important factor for life for all living beings
including man. So, people prefer to live in
areas where fresh or potable water is easily
available. </li>
<li>Soils : Fertile soils are important for
agricultural and allied activities. Therefore,
areas which have fertile loamy soils have
more people living on them, as these can
support intensive agriculture.</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>2. Human Factors :</b></h3>
<ol>
<li>Agriculture : Increase in agricultural
production due to use of fertilisers and
irrigation make it possible to support
more population. Type of agriculture,
crops grown, method of cultivation and
specialisation of particular crops are other
characteristics of agriculture that affect the
distribution of population</li>
<li>Mining : Areas with good quality mineral
deposits attract industries. Mining and
industrial activities generate employment. So, skilled and semi–skilled 
workers move to these areas and make them densely populated.
Katanga copper belt in Zambia, the Chota
Nagpur Plateau in India.</li>
<li>Transportation : Roads or highways may increase the
population here. Such regions are easy to
access because of roads thus increasing
density.Sea transport led to the discovery of
new places. Port cities got developed. The
population grew there due to trade. For
example, the construction of the Suez Canal
increased the exchange of raw materials and
goods.</li>
<li>Urbanisation : The growth of industries
is responsible for the development of
towns and cites. Tertiary activities like
transportation, trade and other services also
increase in order to cater to the needs of the
growing urban population. Cities offer better
employment opportunities, educational and
medical facilities, better means of transport
and communication.</li>
<li>Political factors and government policies :
Besides all the above factors, the policies of
various governments also affect population
distribution and density. A government may
choose to promote population in an area or
depopulate it. For example, the government
promoted human settlement in parts of
Siberia by giving more opportunities.</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>3. IMPORTANT POINTS :</b></h3>
<p align="left">The crude birth rate or death rate is considered ‘crude’. This is because it ignores the age structure of the population. It doesn't take into account that age group in the population that is actually able to give birth. Similarly, actual birth or death rates take into account the population structure of a country.</p>
